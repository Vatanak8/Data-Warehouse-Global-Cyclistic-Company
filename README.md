# Global Cycling Company Data Warehouse 🚴‍♂️🏭

Welcome to the Global Cycling Company Data Warehouse by AdventureWorks 2016 data source! From data collection to insightful reporting, our process involves gathering data from various sources, integrating it into a centralized platform, transforming it for analysis, storing it efficiently, applying advanced analytics techniques, generating insightful reports and visualizations, and continuously improving the warehouse to meet evolving business needs and technological advancements.

# Overview 🌟

The Global Cycling Company Data Warehouse project involves the following key components:

- **Data Consolidation**: Gathering data from transactional databases, external feeds, spreadsheets, and online sales platforms to centralize information for enhanced reporting and analytics.
- **Optimized Utilization**: Structuring and organizing data to ensure accessibility and facilitate insightful analysis.
- **Purposeful Insights**: Leveraging the data warehouse to gain deeper insights into sales trends, customer behavior, inventory management, and market dynamics.
- **Decision Support**: Empowering decision-makers with data-driven strategies for better forecasting, inventory optimization, targeted marketing, and predictive analytics.


# 💾 Dataset 

**AdventureWorks** is a database provided by Microsoft for free on online platforms. It is a product sample database initially published by Microsoft to demonstrate the supposed design of a SQL server database using SQL Server 2019. Here are some key points to know about AdventureWorks:
- AdventureWorks database supports a manufacturing MNC named Adventure Works Cycles.
- It is a sample Online Transaction Processing (or OLTP) database, a type of data processing where multiple transactions occur concurrently. Microsoft ships these with all of their SQL server products.

> This project uses the **Lightweight (LT) data**: a lightweight and pared-down version of the OLTP sample. [Download here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)


# Architecture 🏗️

It utilizes a star schema design with a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables optimized for query performance and simplicity.
